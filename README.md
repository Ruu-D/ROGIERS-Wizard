# ROGIERS-Wizard
  **'Inno Setup' installation wizard for easily implementing frequently used programs and files on new computers.**
  
# Installation
  The compiled '.exe' is used as an **installation wizard** to **perform repeated tasks on new Windows computers in an automated manner**.
  It's very *similar to a '7Zip-self-extracting-executable'*, as it's main purpose is to extract several files in "C:\ROGIERS".
  The 'installer' can be ran multiple times to overwrite older version 'script' files in "C:\ROGIERS".  
  
# Usage
  Running the installer will prompt several 'checkbox' options for the user to run Powershell scripts or perform background installations of software.
  The installation procedure is divided in 2 main versions : "Volledige installatie   (internet vereist)" and "EssentiÃ«le bestanden".
  During the first type, several apps will be installed with the use of 'Chocolatey package manager'.
